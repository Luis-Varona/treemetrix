*TreeMetrix* is a CLI tool for generating synthetic metric spaces from a variety of tree topologies and weight distributions. It is intended for researchers and developers who need to generate distance matrices with known structural properties for testing algorithms, simulating data, or prototyping models. These metric spaces can be used to experiment with techniques for data clustering, dimensionality reduction, nearest neighbor search, and more.
